SYNOPSIS
            use Cisco::IronPort;

            my $ironport = Cisco::IronPort->new(
                    username => $username,
                    password => $password,
                    server   => $server
            );

            my %stats = $ironport->incoming_mail_summary_current_hour;

            print "Total Attempted Messages : $stats{total_attempted_messages}{count}\n";

            # prints...
            # Total Attempted Messages : 932784938
            # Clean Messages : (34%) 

METHODS
  new ( %ARGS )
            my $ironport = Cisco::IronPort->new(
                    username => $username,
                    password => $password,
                    server   => $server
            );

    Creates a Cisco::IronPort object. The constructor accepts a hash
    containing three mandatory and one optional parameter.

    username
       The username of a user authorised to access the reporting API.

    password
       The password of the username used to access the reporting API.

    server
       The target IronPort device hosting the reporting API. This value must
       be either a resolvable hostname or an IP address.

    proto
       This optional parameter may be used to specify the protocol (either
       http or https) which should be used when connecting to the reporting
       API. If unspecified this parameter defaults to https.

  incoming_mail_summary_current_hour
            my %stats = $ironport->incoming_mail_summary_current_hour;
            print "Total Attempted Messages : $stats{total_attempted_messages}{count}\n";

    Returns a nested hash containing incoming mail summary statistics for
    the current hourly period. The hash has the structure show below:

            $stats = {
              'statistic_name_1' => {
                'count'   => $count,
                'percent' => $percent
              },
              'statistic_name_2' => {
                'count'   => $count,
                'percent' => $percent
              },
              ...

              'statistic_name_n => {
                ...
              }

    Valid statistic names are show below - these names are derived from
    those returned by the reporting API with all spaces converted to
    underscores and all characters lower-cased.

    has the following structure:

            measurement_period_1_begin_timestamp => {
              begin_timestamp       => a timestamp marking the beginning of the measurement period in seconds since epoch,
              end_timestamp         => a timestamp marking the ending of the measurement period in seconds since epoch,
              begin_date            => a human-readable timestamp marking the beginning of the measurement period (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ),
              end_date              => a human-readable timestamp marking the ending of the measurement period (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ),
              messages              => the total number of outgoing messages for the measurement period
            },
            measurement_period_2_begin_timestamp => {
              ...
            },
            ...
            measurement_period_n_begin_timestamp => {
              ...
            }

  total_outgoing_messages_current_hour_raw
    Returns a scalar containing statistics for the total number of outgoing
    messages for the previous hourly period as retrieved directly from the
    reporting API.

    This method may be useful if you wish to process the raw data retrieved
    from the API yourself.

  total_outgoing_messages_current_day
    Returns a nested hash containing statistics for the total number of
    outgoing messages for the previous daily period - the hash has the same
    structure as detailed in the
    total_number_of_outgoing_messages_current_hour above.

  total_outgoing_messages_current_day_raw
    Returns a scalar containing statistics for the total number of outgoing
    messages for the previous daily period as retrieved directly from the
    reporting API.

    This method may be useful if you wish to process the raw data retrieved
    from the API yourself.
